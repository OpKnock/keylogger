# Keylogger

Educational keylogger for security research demonstrating input capture, window tracking, and C2 delivery techniques.

## What It Does

- Real-time keyboard event capture with microsecond-precision timestamps
- Active window tracking across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Log rotation with configurable size limits (default 5MB)
- F9 toggle control to pause and resume capture at runtime
- Remote delivery simulation via webhooks for C2 research
- Thread-safe operations with proper resource locking and cleanup

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarterPerez-dev/Cybersecurity-Projects.git
cd Cybersecurity-Projects/PROJECTS/beginner/keylogger
uv sync
python keylogger.py
```

Press **F9** to toggle capture on/off. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop.
